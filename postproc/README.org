** ~dos.jl~
*** Get dependencies
    First load the following packages in your Julia system. To do this, press ~]~ in your Julia repl and say the following:

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    package add DelimitedFiles LinearAlgebra Plots LaTeXStrings ThreadsX ArgParse
    #+END_SRC

    Once done, escape by saying ~Ctrl+c~.
    
    This has to be done just once.
*** Run 
    To run ~dos.jl~ on ~N~ threads, say
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    julia --threads N dos.jl --rundir "<path to completed elphbolt or superconda run>/" --dosof "<species name>" --chempot <chemical potential in eV>
    #+END_SRC

    Above you may choose ~"ph"~ or ~"el"~ for phonons or electrons, respectively. For the latter, you may pass the chemical potential value.

    The results will be written in a subdirectory there called ~postproc_results~.
