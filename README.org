* elphbolt + superconda
  ~elphbolt~ (short for electron-phonon Boltzmann transport) is a modern Fortran (2018 standard) suite of transport codes. It provides a solver for both the coupled /and/ decoupled electron and phonon Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs). You can read about the methodology and implementation here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00710-0. In addition, you get the ~superconda~ app for solving the phonon-mediated superconducting properties within the Eliashberg formalism.

Using /ab initio/ electron-phonon and 3- and 4-phonon interactions and a fully wave vector and electron band/phonon branch resolved formulation of the BTEs, the ~elphbolt~ app gives you the

- phonon and electronic thermal conductivities;
- electronic conductivity;
- phonon and electronic contributions to the thermopower; and
- effect of the mutual electron-phonon drag on the transport coefficients listed above.

Using /ab initio/ electron-phonon and a fully wave vector and electron band/phonon branch resolved, Eliashberg formulation of superconductivity, the ~superconda~ app gives you the

- anisotropic and isotropic Eliashberg spectral function and
- phonon-mediated superconducting transition temperature.

Stylistically, ~elphbolt~ is designed to be simple, small, fast, and extensible. It uses an object-based procedural style, which allows fast development, while resulting in a rather compact source (~ 10k lines of code, generated using David A. Wheeler's ~SLOCCount~). The symmetries of the crystal are fully exploited and the transport active Fermi window is used to allow the sampling of extremely fine wave vector meshes needed for accurate solutions of the BTEs and Eliashberg equations. Parallelism is achieved through modern Fortran's intrinsic ~coarrays~ feature that is fully supported by recent versions of both the ~gcc~ and ~intel~ compilers.

~elphbolt~ currently works with the ~Quantum Espresso~ (https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) suite and its core module ~EPW~ (https://epw-code.org/) for the phonon quantities and the Wannier space information, respectively. An interface with all-electron ~exciting~ (https://exciting-code.org/) code is currently under construction.

~elphbolt~ is a "free as in freedom" code distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3. You can read more about the philosophy of software freedom here: [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html]].

~elphbolt~ is for all of the transport physics community. Feel free to fork and contribute. Create a pull request to incorporate your changes to this project. Tailor it to your own liking/needs and please pay it forward in the spirit of *free software* and *open science*. Let me know of bugs, suggestions for improvement, feature requests, criticism, and praises. You may use the *Discussions* section of this repository for this purpose. There is also a [[https://discord.gg/SZN66GsCHb][discord server]] for informal discussions about theory, set up, usage, extensions, maintenance, possible collaborations, etc. You might find me hanging out there from time to time. I'd love to have a coffee with you and talk physics there in the *office-hour* voice channel.

** Documentation

The source is heavily commented and can be auto-documented with ~FORD~ (https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford). For installation of ~FORD~, consult https://forddocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. To generate the documentation and the call graphs (you need ~graphviz~ for the latter), say ~ford projectfile.md~. Then read ~./documentation/index.html~ with your browser.

** Install on HPC systems with ~gcc~

*** 1. Get ~spglib~

~elphbolt~ uses the ~spglib~ ([[https://spglib.github.io/spglib/]]) library for crystal symmetry analysis. Currently, versions 1.6.0 and 1.14.1 have been tried and tested. A lot of HPCs provide this library as a module, so check before building from source.

*** 2. Get ~OpenCoarrays~

~OpenCoarrays~ ([[http://www.opencoarrays.org]]) is an implementation of the ~coarrays~ functionalities. Some HPC systems include it (for example, MareNostrum4 (BSC) and LaPalma (IAC)). In that case, load it. If not, you can build it from source.

*** 3. Build
    Use one of the following two methods:
**** Using ~fpm~ (v>=0.7)
     For a cpu-only build and test with Fortran Package Manager (https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/), say
     
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      . fpm_config_caf.sh; yes | fpm clean; fpm build; fpm install; fpm test
      #+END_SRC

     The ~elphbolt~ and ~superconda~ apps will be available in your ~/.local/bin~ directory. They should both be directly callable from your shell.

     Modify the fpm manifest file, ~fpm.toml~, to suit your system. I'd appreciate any feedback.

***** Experimental
      For a cpu+gpu build with OpenACC (https://www.openacc.org/), say
      
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      . fpm_config_caf_openacc.sh; yes | fpm clean; fpm build
     #+END_SRC
     
     For this build, you will need a *recent* version of ~gcc~ build with ~nvptx~. You can have it on your HPC system using, for example, spack (https://spack.io/):
     
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     spack install gcc@12.3.0+nvptx
     #+END_SRC
     
     and adding the relevant ~<path to spack build of gcc>/bin~ directory to your ~PATH~.
**** Using ~cmake~
Issue the following command to build and run tests: ~mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; ctest~. If all goes well, the exectuable will be available as ~build/bin/{elphbolt, superconda}~.
** Docker (requires internet connection)
To build a docker image, say

      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      docker build - < Dockerfile
      #+END_SRC
The docker build uses ~cmake~ internally.

** Examples

A full example for cubic silicon is provided. More examples will be added over time.

** Workflow

This is a transport code. And it comes after doing some DFT, DFPT, and Wannier calculations. Users of the popular ~ShengBTE~ ([[https://bitbucket.org/sousaw/shengbte/src/master/]]) code will find that just one extra step (an ~EPW~ calculation) on top of the ~ShengBTE~ workflow is needed to obtain all the input files necessary for a coupled BTEs calculation with ~elphbolt~. You can, however, calculate just a decoupled phonon or electron BTE, or Eliashberg equations if you so choose. For these, only a subset of the input files will be needed. For example, if you want to calculate just a decoupled electron BTE or Eliashberg equations, then you do not need to provide the third order force constants. Similarly, if you are interested in just a phonon BTE without the phonon-electron interactions, then the Wannier parameters are not required.

Following is the full set of input files:

*** Input file

The input file - ~input.nml~ - contains the information about the crystal and the various parameters of the calculation. A full description of all the input parameters is given in the next section. Also take a look at the ~input.nml~ file for the cubic silicon example.

*** Second order interatomic force constants

This comes out of the usual ~ph.x~ and ~q2r.x~ calculation from ~Quantum Espresso~. This file is needed to calculate phonon quantities and must be named ~espresso.ifc2~.

*** Third order interatomic force constants

This code supports the ~thirdorder.py~, dense ~d3q~, and the sparse ~d3q~ formats of the third order force constants file. For the ~d3q~ interface, the sparse format is strongly recommended. Check out [[https://bitbucket.org/sousaw/thirdorder/src/master]] and [[https://anharmonic.github.io/d3q/]] to learn more.

If you seek a solution of the decoupled phonon BTE or the coupled electron-phonon BTEs, at least one of these files, named ~FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD~, ~mat3R~, or ~mat3R.sparse~ for the three supported formats, respectively, must be provided.

*** 4-phonon scattering rates
These are the 4-phonon scattering rates out of the code ~FourPhonon~ (https://github.com/FourPhonon/FourPhonon). You must pass these to ~elphbolt~ if you want to include 4-phonon scattering in the calculation. To turn on the 4-phonon functionality, look up the keys ~fourph~ and ~fourph_mesh_ref~ in the Namelist ~numerics~ below. Take special care when generating the 4-phonon scattering rates in the ~FourPhonon~ code for use in ~elphbolt~. First off, you must choose the wave vector mesh in ~FourPhonon~ such that it scales to the phonon wave vector mesh (~qmesh~) of ~elphbolt~ by a non-zero integer. Secondly, you must pass the irreducible 4-phonon scattering rates data file to ~elphbolt~ as ~FourPhonon_BTE.w_4ph_T<temperature>~. For example, for a $920$ K calculation, the file name should be ~FourPhonon_BTE.w_4ph_T0.920E+03~. Additionally, you must prepend at the top of the file the total number of vectors in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ) of the ~FourPhonon~ calculation. Thirdly, you must provide the file ~FourPhonon_BTE.qpoint_full~. Prepend the total number of wave vectors in the full Brillouin zone (FBZ) of the ~FourPhonon~ calculation. Internally, ~elphbolt~ will interpolate the scattering rates calculated by ~FourPhonon~ on a coarse, say $10\times 10\times 10$, mesh on to a fine ~qmesh~, say $60\times 60\times 60$ for a ~fourph_mesh_ref~ value of $6$. It is always a good idea to plot the interpolated fine mesh scattering rates, ~ph.W_rta_4ph~, to compare against the coarse mesh ones from ~FourPhonon~. It is also good to remember that this is a rather crude way to approximate the effect of the 4-phonon scattering because of the (in general tri-)linear interpolation method used and the fact that the corresponding 4-phonon in-scattering correction is not accounted for in the iterative solver.

*** Wannier space information
These are required if you want to solve a decoupled electron BTE, include phonon-electron interaction in the decoupled phonon BTE, Eliashberg equations for the phonon-mediated superconducting properties, or the coupled electron-phonon BTEs. You have the option of choosing between two external Wannier calculators.

**** ~epw~

These include the files ~rcells_k~, ~rcells_q~, ~rcells_g~, ~wsdeg_k~, ~wsdeg_q~, and ~wsdeg_g~ which must be printed out of an ~EPW~ calculation. We will also need the files ~epmatwp1~ and ~epwdata.fmt~, both of which are outputted by ~EPW~ after the Bloch -> Wannier calculation step. The first contains the Wannier space electron-phonon matrix elements and the second contains the Wannier space dynamical matrix and Hamiltonian. A couple of modified source files can be found in ~EPW/src/~ directory which are needed to correctly print these quantities out during ~EPW~'s Bloch -> Wannier calculation step. The user must recompile their ~EPW~ code following the replacement with these modified source codes. At this time, ~EPW v5.3.1~ (shipped with ~Quantum Espresso v6.7MaX_Release~) must be used for this purpose.

Note that ~elphbolt~ can only read the ~epwdata.fmt~ file only if the ~EPW~ calculation is performed with the flag ~lifc~ set to ~.false.~. I thank Gui-Lin Zhu for pointing this out. In any case, I strongly recommend that the user generates the relevant quantites from ~elphbolt~ along high-symmetry paths and compares directly against ~EPW~ (see next section).

**** ~exciting~
[I will list here the input files from ~exciting~ soon.]

*** High symmetry electron and phonon wave vector path and initial electron wave vector

These are required if you want to plot the electronic bands, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements along high symmetry paths in the Brillouin zone.

You need to provide a wave vector path file named ~highsympath.txt~ (to be used as both the electron and phonon wave vectors) and an initial electron wave vector file named ~initialk.txt~ if you want the electron bands, phonon dispersions, and electron-phonon matrix elements calculated along the path. The first line of ~highsympath.txt~ must be an integer equaling the number of wave vectors in the path. This should be followed by the same number of rows of wave vectors expressed in crystal coordinates (fractions of the reciprocal lattice vectors). The ~initialk.txt~ file must simply contain one wave vector in crystal coordinates.

*** Bespoke screening for the isotropic Eliashberg spectral function

If needed (see flag ~use_external_eps~ below), the isotropic Eliashberg spectral function can be screened with a bespoke dielectric function. In this case, a file named ~eps_squared~ must be placed into the run directory. This will contain a single column of data, giving the modulus-square of the dielectric function at each point in the equidistant phonon energy mesh (see flag ~domega~ below).

** Description of ~input.nml~

For the ~elphbolt~ app, there are 5 Namelists in the ~input.nml~ file: ~allocations~, ~crystal_info~, ~electrons~, ~numerics~, and ~wannier~. For the ~superconda~ app, there is an additional Namelist -- ~superconductivity~. Users of the ~ShengBTE~ code will find the format of this file familiar. Below the keys for each Namelist are described.

*** ~allocations~
