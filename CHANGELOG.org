* v1.1
** New features added/improvements made
   + 4-phonon interactions. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/71][#71]]
   + Phonon-thin-film scattering. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/81][#81]]
   + Exact in-scattering correction due to phonon-isotope and electron-impurity scattering. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/pull/104][#104]]
   + Scissor operator to conduction band. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/83][#83]]
   + Distributed coarray of real-space, Wannier-rep electron-phonon matrix elements. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/62][#62]]
   + Improved method for electron-charged impurity scattering following Ganose et al. Nat. Comm. 12:2222 (2021) and Leveillee et al. PRB 107, 125207 (2023)
   + Portable precision using ~iso_fortran_env~. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/79][#79]]
   + Building with ~CMake~ and ~fpm~ (fortran package manager).[[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/70][#70]]
   + Delta function evaulator is chosen outside of the internal summation loops over states. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/105][#105]]
   + Superconductivity app, ~superconda~. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/87][#87]]
   + Set up unit testing with ~testify~.
   + Github actions.
   + Updated to ~epw~ v5.3.1. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/93][#93]]
   + (Experimental) Offloading to accelerators using OpenACC. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/63][#63]]
   + (Experimental) Interface between ~exciting~ and ~elphbolt~ + ~superconda~. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/85][#85]]
** Removed/no longer supported
   + Building with ~make~.
   + Old method for electron-charged impurity scattering.
** Fixed
   + Bug in the units of the spectral alpha/T in the post-processing step. [[https://github.com/nakib/elphbolt/issues/109][#109]]

* v1.0.1
** Added
   + New abstract data type (ADT) called "particle". The "phonon" and "electron" ADTs are now inherited from "particle".
** Fixed
   + Bug in the dipole correction of the e-ph matrix elements.
